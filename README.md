# ST2-Backbone.Marionette

## [Backbone.Marionette](http://derickbailey.github.com/backbone.marionette/) snippets and tab completions for [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
----

This package for Sublime Text 2 adds snippets for Derick Bailey's [Backbone.Marionette](http://derickbailey.github.com/backbone.marionette/) library.  

It makes a great companion to Tomasz Tunik's Backbone.js ST2 package and borrows heavily from it as well. (which can be found here [https://github.com/tomasztunik/Sublime-Text-2-Backbone.js-package])

Should be available from [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) default channel soon. Optionally (or until then), you can install manually by cloning this repo and copying to your Sublime Text 2 packages folder.
  
`git clone https://github.com/amokan/ST2-Backbone.Marionette`

This was a quick effort to get completions added for my own personal use. I created some snippets after looking into the Backbone.js ST2 package. 
  
If you have any issues, want to complain about things I haven't added yet, or about tab completion issues - drop me a line or submit a pull request. 
  
Thanks!
